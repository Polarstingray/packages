# packages

This is a GitHub repo for any project that I create and want to distribute throughout my homelab.

At this moment, it will store artifacts such as precompiled code (x86-64 Ubuntu 22.04) or important data for those programs to run, rather than the entire project, which needs to be compiled/built on the client's end.
